Hi all! Excited to be here. We've tried to document everything as best we can in the README but please reach out with any questions. Don't hesitate to @ us if you're waiting for a response, though both of us are on the east coast in the US, so be aware any lag might be due to that 😀

Hey! Just wanted to say you have a nice, well-organised/documented easy to understand project for beginners (like me) to get into. Not sure i'm gonna submit something (I'll leave that to the experts) but enjoying myself so far 🙂


[05-Apr-22 04:18 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
so glad to hear that, thank you!

Hi all! Someone pointed out to me that some of the forge tests were failing with the latest foundry version, I pushed fixes for these tests https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed/pull/3. Note `.gas-snapshot` also reflects the latest forge accounting


[05-Apr-22 05:40 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Also, for anyone interested, I am going to do a livestream on Twitch from 5pm - 6pm tonight, going through the code with Transmissions11 and answering any questions in the chat! https://www.twitch.tv/wilsoncusack/schedule?seriesID=9d34b511-f534-4046-9782-81f3de6c73f9

I know it's not in scope, but the site also has some issues 🙂

[05-Apr-22 05:51 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
yes sorry a last minute change broke some stuff, will get it fixed 😀


[05-Apr-22 05:51 AM] renniepak#1983
Np 🙂

Hop over to our discord https://discord.gg/GtryCD2H if you want to talk site / get help with anything outside the audit!


[05-Apr-22 06:55 AM] VAD#3549
Hey! What kind of ERC721 one would expect user to collateral on? Is it normal NFT with rare uri?
Or NFT that hold asset/reward value in other protocol?

Do we even need to consider user might lend token for buggy ERC721 that is impossible to seize?


[05-Apr-22 06:57 AM] VAD#3549
Or the fault just belong to user not checking asset first before lending?


[05-Apr-22 07:09 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Good questions! I should maybe add a note to the readme about the last one: there are many things that can go wrong if lender doesn’t validate the NFT and so these are really out of scope. Could be a fraud, malicious code, etc.


[05-Apr-22 07:09 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
As for what might be lent to, anything that conforms to the standard! From PUNKs to univ3 positions


[05-Apr-22 07:10 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Of course again some caveat that funds could be loss if you borrow against an NFT that is being sent royalties or something: will be stuck in facilitator


[05-Apr-22 07:26 AM] VAD#3549
Just check up on Uniswap v3 NFT.
It is quite interesting on who should get royalties. I will put that on QA since this is out of scope of audits.


[05-Apr-22 08:27 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
yeah I could go on and on about all the things that come up if you try to handle these kinds of cases, quite tricky 🙂


[05-Apr-22 08:27 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
but appreciate it and look forward to reading!


[05-Apr-22 09:39 AM] cmichel#0001
Borrowing NFTs against ERC20 collateral would also be interesting. Then I could borrow a uniswap LP and get fees (like a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap for the lender?) or borrow a BAYC for a day to order merch in their shop

[05-Apr-22 10:13 AM] Pedroais#1630
I'm not submitting any issues related to NFT or ERC20 token contract being malicious as it's up to the lender and borrower to know the NFT/token they are transacting with.


[05-Apr-22 10:14 AM] Pedroais#1630
I think that should be marked out of scope


[05-Apr-22 10:19 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Yeah I think that’s broadly correct. We definitely would want to know if like re-entrancy concerns from unusual contracts, but the space of what a purely malicious contract could do is far too wide to cover


[05-Apr-22 10:22 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Yeah I think you’d want like a contract to hold it where the “borrower” could make any call from that contract. Contract would just need to assert it still owned the NFT after the call 😁

this was great, learnt a couple of tricks from the optimizoooor 😂  😂

How come the UI on https://rinkeby.withbacked.xyz/ shows 4 decimal points for interest rate? Isnt it supposed to be just 1?


[06-Apr-22 02:50 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Site is getting updated  😀

If you're submitting gas findings, please make sure you validate them with `forge snapshot`. Have seen quite a few that do not save gas 😀


[07-Apr-22 03:13 AM] sorryNotsorry#1586

[07-Apr-22 03:22 AM] wilsoncusack#2613
Yup! Others have been able to lmk if you have issues
